# CONTEXT: HOW TO REVIEW (Apply Silently)

1.  **You are reviewing a code file for executive-level analysis.** Focus on business impact, technical debt, security risks, and maintainability.
2.  **Focus your review on the most critical aspects.** Prioritize findings that have business impact or security implications.
3.  **Infer context from the full code.** Base your review on the complete file provided.
4.  **Your entire response MUST be under 65,000 characters.** Include findings of all severities but prioritize Critical and High severity issues.

# REVIEW PRIORITIES (Strict Order)
1.  Security & Correctness
2.  Reliability & Error-handling
3.  Performance & Complexity
4.  Readability & Maintainability
5.  Testability

# SEVERITY GUIDELINES (Be Realistic and Balanced)
-   **Critical:** Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, system crashes
-   **High:** Error handling gaps, performance bottlenecks, significant maintainability issues
-   **Medium:** Code quality improvements, minor performance issues, documentation gaps
-   **Low:** Style improvements, minor optimizations, non-critical suggestions

# ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR FINDINGS (ALL must be met)
-   **Evidence:** Quote the exact code snippet and cite the line number.
-   **Severity:** Assign {Low | Medium | High | Critical} - BE REALISTIC, most issues should be Medium or Low.
-   **Impact & Action:** Briefly explain the issue and provide a minimal, safe correction.
-   **Non-trivial:** Skip purely stylistic nits (e.g., import order, line length) that a linter would catch.

# HARD CONSTRAINTS (For accuracy & anti-hallucination)
-   Do NOT propose APIs that don't exist for the imported modules.
-   Treat parameters like `db_path` as correct dependency injection; do NOT call them hardcoded.
-   NEVER suggest logging sensitive user data or internal paths. Suggest non-reversible fingerprints if context is needed.
-   Do NOT recommend removing correct type hints or docstrings.
-   If code in the file is already correct and idiomatic, do NOT invent problems.

---
# OUTPUT FORMAT (Strict, professional, audit-ready)

Your entire response MUST be under 65,000 characters. Include findings of all severity levels with realistic severity assignments.

## Code Review Summary

---
### Detailed Findings
*A list of all material findings. If no significant issues are found, state "No significant issues found."*

**File:** {filename}
-   **Severity:** {Critical | High | Medium | Low}
-   **Line:** {line_number}
-   **Function/Context:** `{function_name_if_applicable}`
-   **Finding:** {A clear, concise description of the issue, its impact, and a recommended correction.}

**(Repeat for each finding)**

---
### Key Recommendations
*Provide 2-3 high-level, actionable recommendations for improving the overall quality of the codebase based on the findings. Do not repeat the findings themselves.*

# CODE TO REVIEW

{PY_CONTENT}
"""

PROMPT_TEMPLATE_CONSOLIDATED = """
You are an expert code review summarization engine for executive-level reporting. Your task is to analyze individual code reviews and generate a single, consolidated executive summary with business impact focus.

You MUST respond ONLY with a valid JSON object that conforms to the executive schema. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside of the JSON structure.

Follow these instructions to populate the JSON fields:

1.  **`executive_summary` (string):** Write a 2-3 sentence high-level summary of the entire code change, covering the most important findings across all files with business impact focus.
2.  **`quality_score` (number):** Assign an overall quality score (0-100) based on severity and number of findings.
3.  **`business_impact` (string):** Assess overall business risk as "LOW", "MEDIUM", or "HIGH".
4.  **`technical_debt_score` (string):** Evaluate technical debt as "LOW", "MEDIUM", or "HIGH".
5.  **`security_risk_level` (string):** Determine security risk as "LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH", or "CRITICAL".
6.  **`maintainability_rating` (string):** Rate maintainability as "POOR", "FAIR", "GOOD", or "EXCELLENT".
7.  **`detailed_findings` (array of objects):** Create an array of objects, where each object represents a single, distinct issue found in the code:
         -   **`severity`**: Assign severity realistically: "Low", "Medium", "High", or "Critical". MOST ISSUES SHOULD BE Medium or Low. Only use Critical for security vulnerabilities or data loss risks. Only use High for significant errors or performance issues.
         -   **`category`**: Assign category: "Security", "Performance", "Maintainability", "Best Practices", "Documentation", or "Error Handling".
         -   **`line_number`**: Extract the specific line number if mentioned in the review. If no line number is available, use "N/A".
         -   **`function_context`**: From the review text, identify the function or class name where the issue is located. If not applicable, use "global scope".
         -   **`finding`**: Write a clear, concise description of the issue, its potential impact, and a concrete recommendation. LIMIT TO 12 WORDS MAXIMUM.
         -   **`business_impact`**: Explain how this affects business operations or risk. LIMIT TO 12 WORDS MAXIMUM.
         -   **`recommendation`**: Provide specific technical solution.
         -   **`effort_estimate`**: Estimate effort as "LOW", "MEDIUM", or "HIGH".
         -   **`priority_ranking`**: Assign priority ranking (1 = highest priority).
         -   **`filename`**: The name of the file where the issue was found.
         -   **`is_previous_issue`**: "Yes" or "No" - whether this issue existed in previous review.
         -   **`resolution_status`**: "New", "Not Addressed", "Partially Resolved", "Resolved", or "Worsened" - status compared to previous review.
8.  **`metrics` (object):** Include technical metrics:
         -   **`lines_of_code`**: Total number of lines analyzed across all files.
         -   **`complexity_score`**: "LOW", "MEDIUM", or "HIGH".
         -   **`code_coverage_gaps`**: Array of areas needing test coverage.
         -   **`dependency_risks`**: Array of dependency-related risks.
9.  **`strategic_recommendations` (array of strings):** Provide 2-3 high-level, actionable recommendations for technical leadership.
10. **`immediate_actions` (array of strings):** List critical items requiring immediate attention.
11. **`previous_issues_resolved` (array of objects):** For each issue from previous review, indicate status:
         -   **`original_issue`**: Brief description of the previous issue
         -   **`status`**: "RESOLVED", "PARTIALLY_RESOLVED", "NOT_ADDRESSED", or "WORSENED"
         -   **`details`**: Explanation of current status

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR BALANCED REVIEWS:**
Your entire response MUST be under {MAX_CHARS_FOR_FINAL_SUMMARY_FILE} characters. Include findings of all severity levels with realistic severity assignments:
-   Use "Critical" only for security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, or system crashes
-   Use "High" only for significant error handling gaps or major performance issues  
-   Use "Medium" for code quality improvements and minor performance issues
-   Use "Low" for style improvements and non-critical suggestions
-   REALISTIC DISTRIBUTION: Expect mostly Medium (40-50%) and Low (30-40%) severity findings, with fewer High (10-20%) and very few Critical (0-5%)

"""

PROMPT_TEMPLATE_WITH_CONTEXT = """
You are reviewing subsequent commits for Pull Request #{pr_number}. 

PREVIOUS REVIEW SUMMARY AND FINDINGS:
{previous_context}

PREVIOUS DETAILED FINDINGS FOR INTELLIGENT COMPARISON:
{previous_findings_json}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You must analyze the new code changes with full awareness of the previous feedback. Specifically:

1. **INTELLIGENT ISSUE TRACKING:** For each current finding, determine if it relates to a previous issue by analyzing:
   - Same file and similar line numbers (±10 lines tolerance)
   - Similar issue descriptions or root causes
   - Same security/performance/maintainability category
   - Conceptually related problems (e.g., "hardcoded credentials" vs "credentials in plaintext")

2. **RESOLUTION STATUS LOGIC:**
   - "New": Issue didn't exist in previous review
   - "Not Addressed": Identical or very similar issue still exists at same location
   - "Partially Resolved": Issue improved but not fully fixed (e.g., moved to config but still hardcoded)
   - "Resolved": Previous issue no longer exists (don't include in current findings)
   - "Worsened": Similar issue but now more severe or widespread

3. **POPULATE REQUIRED FIELDS:** For each finding in detailed_findings array, you MUST include:
   - `is_previous_issue`: "Yes" if this relates to any previous finding, "No" if completely new
   - `resolution_status`: Use the logic above to determine accurate status

4. **EXECUTIVE INTELLIGENCE:** Don't just do text matching. Understand the code context:
   - If line numbers changed due to refactoring, still track the logical issue
   - If an issue was moved from one function to another, track the conceptual continuity
   - If recommendations were implemented but incompletely, mark as "Partially Resolved"

5. **PREVIOUS ISSUES RESOLVED SECTION:** List issues from previous review that are NOT in current findings:
   - These should be marked as "RESOLVED" with details about what was fixed
